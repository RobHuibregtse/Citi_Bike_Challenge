# Citi_Bike_Challenge

The code is supplementary to the Module 18 Citi Bike Challenge. The code does the following: 

1. Combines all Jew Jersey Citi Bike ride data from 2024 into one data frame
2. Uses the Geoapify API to figure out the city of each start and end destination and add those to each row
3. Save a csv file of the combined data.
